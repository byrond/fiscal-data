## About Fiscal Data

Fiscal Data is your one-stop shop for federal financial data. The Department
of the Treasury and the Bureau of the Fiscal Service created Fiscal Data to
consolidate federal financial data into one easy-to-use website. Fiscal Data
adheres to modern data practices and offers data in machine-readable formats via
file downloads and application programming interfaces (APIs).

### What Makes Fiscal Data Different

- **Human-Centered Design**

  Usability is a core value we have embraced from the start of the development
  of this website. Throughout development, we have integrated best practices and
  user feedback to deliver a modern, easy-to-navigate site.

- **Machine-Readable Data Downloads**

  All of our datasets are available for download in multiple machine-readable
  formats and feature customizable data previews. Additionally, each dataset is
  complete with comprehensive metadata to explain when the data is updated, what
  each row of the data represents, and descriptions for each dataset and data table.

- **Easily Accessible APIs**

  With complete documentation and APIs for each dataset, accessing data has never
  been easier. New to APIs? Visit our [getting started section](/api-documentation/#getting-started)

### Background

Fiscal Service is a leader in the open data community within the federal
government. In 2018, we re-launched USAspending.gov to enhance the public’s
ability to examine and track federal spending data and we launched a new
website, Data Lab. Based on the principles outlined in the 2019
**Foundations for Evidence-Based Policymaking Act** and the 2020
**Federal Data Strategy Action Plan**, Fiscal Data builds on our
data transparency work by modernizing how we provide data to the public.

### Open Data Policy

Fiscal Service recognizes the importance of providing accurate data on the financial
operations of the federal government to the public. This information is critical
for the proper functioning of markets, the efficient management of the federal
government, and ensuring the trust of the American people. The OCDO developed an
[Open Data Policy](/data/about-us/901-1%20Open%20Data%20Policy.pdf) which outlines policies
and procedures governing Fiscal Service’s open data. Fiscal Service’s publicly available data
will be made accessible on Fiscal Data. Please visit us regularly for updates to the Open
Data Policy.

### Data Sources

The mission of Fiscal Service is to promote the financial integrity and
operational efficiency of the federal government through exceptional
accounting, financing, collections, payments, and shared services. We pay,
collect, finance, and account for trillions of dollars each year. Our datasets
come from the systems that perform these critical functions such as debt management
systems and summary debt accounting systems. Each dataset notes the publisher, which
indicates the area within Fiscal Service from which the data originated.

<section id='understanding-the-data'>

### Understanding the Data

As a first step in improving the usability of our data, we have focused on
increasing the metadata available to users, including complete data dictionaries
for each dataset, explicit notes and limitations to help users understand the data,
and detailed metadata to explain when the data is updated, what each row of the data
represents, and descriptions for each dataset and data table.
