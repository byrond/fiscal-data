    <p>
      The debt ceiling, or debt limit, is a restriction imposed by Congress on
      the amount of outstanding national debt that the federal government can
      have. The debt ceiling is the amount that the Treasury can borrow to pay
      the bills that have become due and pay for future investments. Once the
      debt ceiling is reached, the federal government cannot increase the amount
      of outstanding debt, losing the ability to pay bills and fund programs and
      services. However, the Treasury can use extraordinary measures authorized
      by Congress to temporarily suspend certain intragovernmental debt allowing
      it to borrow to fund programs or services for a limited amount of time
      after it has reached the ceiling.
    </p>
    <p>
      Since the United States has never defaulted on its obligations, the scope
      of the negative repercussions related to a default are unknown but would
      likely have catastrophic repercussions in the United States and in markets
      across the globe.

    Three different Fiscal Data datasets are used for federal debt values on
    this page. {debtToThePenny} provides daily values; values from the December{" "}
    {mspd} are used for visualizations showing calendar years; and{" "}
    {historicalDebt} provides an annual value for fiscal years. Interest rates
    are pulled from the {treasurySecurities} dataset. Adjustments for inflation
    are calculated using Consumer Price Index values from the {bls}. Fiscal year
    Gross Domestic Product values from the {bea} are calculated by averaging
    four relevant quarterly values from calendar year quarter 4 of the prior
    year through calendar year quarter 3 of the fiscal year shown. For detailed
