        The federal government spends money on a variety of goods, programs, and
        services that support the economy and people of the United States. The federal
        government also spends money on the interest it has incurred on outstanding
        federal debt. Consequently, as the debt grows, the spending on interest expense
        also generally grows. If the government spends more than it collects in revenue,
        then there is a budget deficit. If the government spends less than it collects in
        revenue, there is a budget surplus.

        If the government spends more than it collects in revenue, then there is a budget
        deficit. If the government spends less than it collects in revenue, there is a
        budget surplus. In fiscal year (FY) YYYY (latest complete fiscal year), the
        government spent $XX.X trillion, which was more/less than it collected
        (revenue), resulting in a deficit/surplus. Visit the national deficit explainer
        to see how the deficit and revenue compare to federal spending

        Federal government spending pays for everything from Social Security and Medicare
        to military equipment, highway maintenance, building construction, research, and
        education. This spending can be broken down into two primary categories: mandatory
        and discretionary. These purchases can also be classified by object class and
        budget functions.

        Throughout this page, we use outlays to represent spending. This is money that has
        actually been paid out and not just promised to be paid. When issuing a contract or
        grant, the U.S. government enters a binding agreement called an obligation. This
        means the government promises to spend the money, either immediately or in the
        future. As an example, an obligation occurs when a federal agency signs a contract,
        awards a grant, purchases a service, or takes other actions that require it to make
        a payment. Obligations do not always result in payments being made, which is why we
        show actual outlays that reflect actual spending occurring.

        According to the Constitution’s Preamble, the purpose of the federal government is
        “…to establish Justice, insure domestic Tranquility, provide for the common defense,
        promote the general Welfare, and secure the Blessings of Liberty to ourselves and
        our Posterity.” These goals are achieved through government spending.
